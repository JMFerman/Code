      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Jose—a curious mind, a dedicated learner, and someone who deeply believes that mental health isn’t just personal, it’s universal. I created this space not as an expert from a pedestal, but as a person who’s walked through confusion, growth, setbacks, and breakthroughs. I blend compassion with curiosity, using storytelling, science, and honest conversations to explore what it really means to take care of your mind. This platform is a judgment-free zone!
